This is Task 05 of the Eudyptula Challenge
------------------------------------------

Yeah, you survived the coding style mess!  Now, on to some "real"
things, as I know you are getting bored by these so far.

So, two simple tasks this time around:
  - Take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it so that
    when a USB keyboard is plugged in, the module will be automatically
    loaded by the correct userspace hotplug tools (which are implemented
    by depmod / kmod / udev / mdev / systemd, depending on what distro
    you are using.)
  - Again, provide "proof" this all works.

Yes, so simple, and yet, it's a bit tricky.  As a hint, go read chapter
14 of the book, "Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition."  Don't worry, it's
free, and online, no need to go buy anything.
